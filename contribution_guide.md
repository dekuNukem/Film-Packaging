----------

Thank you for supporting this project!

Please read this short guide on how to submit your own scans.

## Prerequisites

Your film packaging should be:

* Intact & Legible
	* Not missing significant portions of the box
* Unique
	* [Take a look at the archive page](./film_packaging/by_brand.md)
	* It should be **`NOT exactly the same`** as an existing entry
	* OR **`in better condition than`** an existing entry so it can be replaced

Feel free to submit if those requirements are met!

## Equipment

A **Flatbed Scanner** is highly recommended.

Any will do, mine is more than 20 years old.

## Preparation

Ideally, you should **take apart the box** while **minimizing damage**.

Each box is different, but generally you can:

* Carefully lift the end flaps

* Look inside the box
* Locate the corner with the fold-over
* Unfold (or cut) along the edge

* Wipe with **dry** microfibre cloth to remove dust and fingerprints

## Scanning

* Scan at 800 / 1200 **DPI** (Dots per inch)
* JPEG format, ~90% quality.
* **Longest side** should have at **least 4000 pixels**.

------

* Ensure the scans include:
	* Outside
	* Inside (Only if there is text)
	* Leaflets (All pages with text)
	* Processing Envelopes (If any)
* Straighten and crop if necessary. (Don't crop too tight, leave some space.)

⚠️ DO NOT perform excessive post-processing! Flatter is preferable.

## Sample Scan

Yours should look similar to this. Click to enlarge.
